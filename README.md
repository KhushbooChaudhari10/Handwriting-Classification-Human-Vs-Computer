Abstract

Think about when you write something by hand, like a note or a signature. Now, imagine a computer trying to copy that in a way that looks exactly like you did it. That's what we're dealing with - computers getting really good at imitating human handwriting. Our project is all about making a clever tool that can quickly decide if a piece of writing is from a person or a computer. It helps us check if important papers are real or if someone's trying to trick us. We want to make sure this tool is not just smart but also really quick, so anyone can use it easily. Our report takes you through the journey of understanding this challenge and building a solution that makes us trust handwritten stuff in our digital world.




Introduction

In today's world, figuring out if writing is done by a person or a computer is super important. Think about crime solving and making sure documents are realâ€”handwriting detection is at the heart of these things. But now, with computers getting really good at mimicking human writing, telling the difference has become quite a puzzle. This project is all about creating a smart system that can easily tell if a piece of writing is made by a human or a computer.
